📊 Istanbul Population Analysis and Visualization — Bar Chart Race

This project visualizes the population changes of Istanbul districts over time — starting from 2015 — using population data obtained from the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality (İBB) Open Data Portal and presenting them through a bar chart race animation.

This work allows users to dynamically explore how the population of Istanbul’s districts has changed over the years.
